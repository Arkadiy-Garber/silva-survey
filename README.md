Program for inferring isolation source from a clade of organisms in SILVA

The latest release of the SILVA database of candidate small-subunit (SSU) 16S rRNA gene sequences encompasses over 6 million sequences. These sequences are derived from a variety of sources, including isolated cultures, as well as those derived from environmentally-derived sources. This database, thus, represents a useful repository for assesing the diversity and environemtal distribution of microbial life on Earth.

The silva-survey program takes as input any taxanomically-derived name that would be found in a SILVA sequence header. This name could be at any taxanomic level, as specific as "Shewanella" and as broad as "Bacteria".
